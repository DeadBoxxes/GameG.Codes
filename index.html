  <h2>Super Mario World (NES) HUMMER TEAM
    <li>AAAAA--<br>AAAAAA--AAAAAE - removes logo and changes graphics to a minor extent</li>
    <li>AAAAAAE - almost the same as the previous but distorts music messes with the title screen even more</li>
    <li>POOZVVNN<br>UULXXZ--<br>ZOPPPP-- - when on the world 1 map and when pressing down, mario will fly off screen, and the game crashes, leaving an F on the screen... lol, different worlds can effect the outcome of the crash </li>
     <li>YYLLLL-- - in the first level, enimies will despawn almost immediatley after being on screen, this is only the case for level 1 and any other levels are basically normal.</li>
    <li>EEPOSS-- - messes up the overworld music for level 1 and bonzai bill/lava bubbles are stationary</li>
    <li>ISTLXZ-- - makes you jump very high (however, this causes the screen to bug out and some levels may crash or clip you into objects at certain points, jumping on enimies makes you clip through the floor too...)</li>
    <li>ISTLZZ-- - you start with cape,</li>
    <li>IITLUZ-- - you jump so high the background shifts, or as i like to call it... heaven mode!</li>
